# PRODIGY-DS-03
 
This project demonstrates how to build and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (variable `y`) based on various features such as age, job, marital status, education, etc.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

After running the script, the model will be trained and evaluated. The accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report will be printed in the console. The decision tree will be visualized and displayed.


**SAMPLE DATASET:**  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

Also the CSV file used here is uploaded in the repository.
